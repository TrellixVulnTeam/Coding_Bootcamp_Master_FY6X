GIT_Commands_Level_1:

GIT is distributed version control system

md or mkdir "foldername" : This is for creating a new folder
cd : For opening folder and entering using command promt
ls : Show the list of files
ls-ll: Reports the number of files present in that folder
ls-la: (Hidden file) which stores versions data of the files
git init: Intitiate git repository
cd .git : To open the git folder(if you do ls now, We can see Hidden files(Version information))
tree : To see details of versions
touch "filename" : To add or create file to your directory location inside folder
git status: To know status of files
git add . : After adding or giving files to git, the files are said to be in stagging area.
git commit -m "comment" : File is saved GIT repo and we call this as snapshot
rm "filename" : To remove file from folder
To remove or move file from stagging area to working area before commiting
We use

git rm --cached "filename" : To move file from stagging area to working area
echo "Hello" >> "filename" : Echo is to write or add some content code into the file
cat "filename" : To observe content of file or read any file we use cat

We can also skip stagging area and directly enter snapshot from working area using:
git commit -a -m "comment" : Before using this command we need to add it for first time but from 2nd time no need to add

git branch : It displays branch in which you are present
git log : To see all saves and commits of past history

To add changes we create a new branch,
git checkout -b "new branch name or develop" : this creates a develop branch
git checkout "branchname" : To naviagte between branches

How to merge 2 branches?
Go to branch where you want make merge
1)git checkout main
2)git merge "branchname or develop" : This is what you want merge to main branch
3)git push : we can see added files in git repo

git push origin play : Push to that particular branch

git clone "url" : To download files to local from remote repo
git pull: git fetch + git merge
git pull origin "branchname" : To get latest changes

after creating new branch and made changes we need to do ACP commands and puch the code to repo for merge and conflict removing process

Always make a pull from main branch before you start

git branch -a : To see all exisiting branches

git branch -d : To remove or delete branch
or
git branch -D : To remove or delete branch(forced deletion)

git merge main : To add main branch updated contents into current working branch from current branch(operations needs to performed)

Resolving conflicts is done through git bash, git hub and git hub local by manaully operating

git mv Hello.txt Bye.txt : To rename an existing file

C1<-C2<-C3

To see prior commits 
git checkout HEAD~2
